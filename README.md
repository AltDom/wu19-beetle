## About This Project
This is the final assignment that I completed for a 9-week course on Design & Visual Communication taught by Alexander Tengner from Fully Studios. It is a homepage for the '57 Volkswagen Beetle which is responsive (renders for mobile & desktop window widths), and was built using HTML, CSS & Javascript as well as all of the programs and online tools we were introduced to in the course. These include Figma, Adobe Photoshop & Adobe Illustrator.
